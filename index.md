The 26th Postgraduate Combinatorial Conference (PCC) will be held in Oxford on 10th-12th June 2019.

The PCC is an established conference organised by, and for, current research students in all areas of combinatorial and discrete mathematics, under the auspices of the British Combinatorial Committee. The PCC is mainly aimed at UK-based students, but is also open to those from abroad.

The aim of the conference is to allow research students to discuss their research in a relaxed environment, to gain practice at presenting their research outside of their own department, and to meet other young researchers in their area. Each student is encouraged to contribute by giving a talk which will last 25 minutes (including 5 minutes question and answer time).

# Location

The conference will be hosted in room L5 of the Andrew Wiles Building, Oxford.

# Travel and Accommodation

We hope to be able to reimburse all students’ travel costs up to a maximum amount of around £50-60 (details to follow). There is very little parking at the Andrew Wiles Building and driving should be avoided if at all possible. For more information about the parking at the Andrew Wiles Building, click [here](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/building-information/parking-travel){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Since we expect that most participants prefer to organise their own accommodation, using AirBnB or similar, we haven’t booked any specific accommodation for this meeting. For those that prefer a traditional hotel, here are some options near the conference.
